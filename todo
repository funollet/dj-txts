- (Txts) add "author" field
- (Txts) add "comments_closed" field
* (Txts) 'permalink' is a confusing denomination; get_absolute_url *is* the permalink.
* (Txts) admin isn't sorting by pub_date
* (Txts) add categories ???
* photostream_update script: doesn't refresh modified fields (title, modif_date).
* remove #photo23-content from CSS and 'home_list.html'

* (RETHINK!!!) feeds: move to a directory out of every app; should be overwriten by project 
* Tag list on sidebar (needs templatetag).
* Pagination in blog list templates.
* Date-based navigation.
* (Feeds) add author
* (Feeds) OpenKnowledgeFeed is slooooow ?
* (Link category) add a 'hide' field so we could filter this when showing "all" sections.
  Usefull for things like blogrolls. Does it makes sense having a menu builder application?
* find a better way than hack (patch django) for fixing custom 'rows' value in admin textarea
* (Txt) tweak admin: longer '#id_body textarea'.
  Not easy: can't be done on change_form.html, probably implies customizing some
  admin templatetag.
* Use txts.comments_closed in views/templates.

* Suggest to TagsField developper: why remove '-' from tag's norm_value?
* (Event) views showing events as lists.
* Implement LazyDateTime (as in django.db.models.LazyDate). Use as pub_date default
  value. LazyDate fixes time at midnight, not now().

* Create bin/deploy_farbtastic script.
* Use field.ImageWithThumbnail()
* Txt preview for admin: make it an appl ???
* BUG: django.views.generic.archive_today doesn't respect month_format parameter
* (Txt) tweak admin:  float markup_help at textarea's right. Why aligns to textarea bottom?
