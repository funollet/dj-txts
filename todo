Deploying djapps to other projects
----------------------------------

'svn co' the applications. Manually install 'media/' files (jquery,...).

Must rethink 'templates/'. Some templates (global and admin-related) are on 'djapps' svn,
but can't do 'svn co' because root 'templates/' dir is on site-project svn.

Meanwhile, sync it manually.

  bean$ rsync -avC ~/code/djapps/templates/{admin,base.html} .

Take an eye on the Google SoC django-package.
