* 'update_photoplanet.py' not working on TextDrive

* terraquis still using django-r4463
  * 
* (Txts) 'permalink' is a confusing denomination; get_absolute_url *is* the permalink.
  Rename to 'easylink'.
  * terraquis: script to migrate actual data
* Tags: migrate Txts to django-tags application
  * terraquis: script to migrate actual content (tags -> tagging)
* (Txts) add categories ???
* uecweb: deploy Txts
* uecweb: deploy with mysql/postgres
* test with django-trunk post unicode-branch
  * uecweb @ textdrive: solves the fcgi bug?


* (RETHINK!!!) feeds: move to a directory out of every app.
  * should be overwriten per-project 
  * Common feeds on projects root and per-appl on each directory? Easy to distribute.
* remove #photo23-content from CSS and 'home_list.html'
* build menus application (uecweb needs it); some lieder apps can be used
* build/choose media uploading application

* (PhotoPlanet) admin: url auto-completion
* (PhotoPlanet) photo links to photo ('/mblog'), not to "page photo"
* use 'url' templatetag and 'permalink' on 'get_absolute_url'
* Farbtastic upgraded? If so, update Farbtastic and jQuery.
* update_photoplanet script: doesn't refresh modified fields (title, modif_date).
* Calendar: could we reuse this? http://www.djangosnippets.org/snippets/129/

* preview doesn't respects fields order (because they are on a dictionary)
* Tag list on sidebar.
* Pagination in blog list templates.
* Date-based navigation.
* (Feeds) add author
* (Feeds) OpenKnowledgeFeed is slooooow ?
* Use txts.comments_closed in views/templates.

* (Event) views showing events as lists.

* Create bin/deploy_farbtastic script.
* Use field.ImageWithThumbnail()
* BUG: django.views.generic.archive_today doesn't respect month_format parameter
* (Txt) tweak admin:  float markup_help at textarea's right. Why aligns to textarea bottom?



Deploying djapps to other projects
----------------------------------

'svn co' the applications. Manually install 'media/' files (jquery,...).

Must rethink 'templates/'. Some templates (global and admin-related) are on 'djapps' svn,
but can't do 'svn co' because root 'templates/' dir is on site-project svn.

Meanwhile, sync it manually.

  bean$ rsync -avC ~/code/djapps/templates/{admin,base.html} .

Take an eye on the Google SoC django-package.
